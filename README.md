Tag-Recommender Framework
========================

Welcome to our Tag-Recommender project!

The aim of this work is to provide the community with a simple to use generic tag-recommender framework to evaluate novel tag-recommender algorithms with a set of well-known std. IR metrics such as MAP, MRR, P@k, R@K and folksonomy datasets such as BibSonomy, CiteULike, LastFM or Delicious and to benchmark the approach against state-of-the-art tag-recommender algorithms such as MP, MP_r, MP_u, MP_u,r, CF, APR, FR, GIRP, GIRPTM, etc.

Need more information how to use the framework? Then, please have a look at the Wiki or contact us.
